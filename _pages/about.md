I am a third year Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science at Peking University, advised by Professor [Chenren Xu](https://soar.group/chenren/). My research focuses on ​hardware-software co-design systems​ to enhance sensing capabilities for interpreting environments/intentions of ​humans​/agents.

I received my B.S degree from the School of Physics at Peking University in 2022. Beyond my current research, I am also interested in the cross field of natural science and wireless networking -- how to learn from other fields and how to build better wireless sensing system for other fields.
