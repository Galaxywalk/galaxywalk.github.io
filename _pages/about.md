I am a 1st year Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science at Peking University, advised by Professor [Chenren Xu](https://soar.group/chenren/). My research interest lies in mobile computing, wireless sensing, and human-computer interaction.

I received my B.S degree from the School of Physics at Peking University in 2022. Beyond my current research, I am also interested in the cross field of natural science and wireless networking -- how to learn from other fields and how to build better wireless sensing system for other fields.
