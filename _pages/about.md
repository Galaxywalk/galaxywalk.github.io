I am a third year Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science at Peking University, advised by Professor [Chenren Xu](https://soar.group/chenren/). My research focuses on ​hardware-software co-design systems​ to enhance sensing capabilities for ​humans​ and embodied agents. This is my [CV](../files/CV_bo.pdf).

I received my B.S degree from the School of Physics at Peking University in 2022. Besides my current research, I am also interested in the cross field of natural science and wireless networking -- how to build better wireless systems to prompt science researches.
