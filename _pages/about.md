I am a 1st year Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science at Peking University, advised by Professor [Chenren Xu](https://soar.group/chenren/). My research interest lies in mobile computing, wireless networking, and human-computer interaction.

I received my B.S degree from the School of Physics at Peking University in 2022. I am interested in the cross field of natural science and wireless networking -- how to use the fundamental theory or long-neglected effects in physics/communication theory/biology to build better wireless sensing, computing, and communication system. I also like to build small but interesting devices in life.
